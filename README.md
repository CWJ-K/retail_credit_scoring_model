# retail_credit_scoring_model
In many regions all over the world, thousands of people have to apply for loans to invest in capital such as auto vehicles, for themselves and their families. These people differ in demographic and financial capabilities. For this reason, firms that provide these loans should take great measures to carefully monitor, store and analyse their information. It becomes paramount for them to give loans to the customers they are confident will be able to repay them. Such companies need to look out for aspects like risk of fraud, insurance and customer attrition, all the while trying to maximise profit.

This report aims to build a retail credit scoring model for Auto Finance LTD, a loan provider part of larger conglomerate in India, to help them determine whether to grant or reject loan applications. Auto Finance LTD identifies the lower-middle class as their target audience. Two logistic regression techniques, binary and ordered, are used to analyse the data of previous customers over approximately a decade. This analysis will be conducted in consideration of consumer behaviour, and with the assumption that future customers have similar behaviour to past customers. The following sections include exploratory data analysis, data preparation, model analysis, managerial recommendations, and conclusion.
